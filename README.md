1. I used the standard c version of finding system time becuase it seemed easier and it was the first method i found on google
2. i used <sstream> lib so that i could create a ostringstream and use iomanip and return a string
3. I didnt use the chrono function because i didnt really understand it and using modular arithematic seemed much easier.
